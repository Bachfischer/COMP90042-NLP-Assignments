# COMP90042-NLP-Assignments

This repository contains the source code for assignment 1 and 2 of the COMP90042 Natural Language Processing course at the University of Melbourne.

## Assignment 1

The objective of this assignment was to perform text analysis on a collection of tweets. The task was to predict the geolocation (country) from which a given tweet comes from. The assignment also involved writing code to preprocess data and perform text classification.

Further details can be found in the project specification ***as1.ipynb*** or in the Python notebook ***as1-Matthias_Bachfischer.ipynb***.

## Assignment 2

The objective of this assignment was to create an 'artificial intelligence' player for the classic Hangman word guessing game. The task was to implement several different automatic strategies based on character-level n-gram language models. These automatic strategies have then been used to implement an automatic player which makes the fewest mistakes in the Hangman game.
