We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3</b>.  \n",

The test set should contain 1000 word types, and the rest should be in the  training set.

    "**Instructions:** The length of the secret word is an important clue that we might exploit. Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

    "**Instructions:** Now for the next challenge, you'll build a **bigram language model** over characters. The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`. Similarly the distribution over characters that start or end a word are highly biased (e.g., toward common prefixes and suffixes, like *un-*, *-ed* and *-ly*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The task here is to develop a bigram language model over characters, and train it over the training words. Remember to be careful when handling the start of each word properly, e.g., by padding with a special starting symbol such as `$`. Do we also need a special ending symbol? That's for you to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bigram guesser should apply your language model to each blank position in the secret word by using its left context character. For example, in the partial word `e _ c _ b _ _` we know the left context for the first three blanks, but have no known left context for the last blank. In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model). You should sum up the probability distribution (over all alphabets from <i>a</i> to <i>z</i>) for the 4 blanks, and select the alphabet with the highest probability that hasn't been guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Collect frequency counts that are necessary for building a bigram language model and store them in bigram_counts; feel free to add new objects if needed (use the first answer space). Complete the `bigram_guesser` method (use the second answer space). Note that the method currently only has one additional argument (`bigram_counts`), but you are free to add additional arguments."
